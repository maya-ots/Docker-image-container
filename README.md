# Docker-image-container
### This repository documents the completion of the DevOps challenge :
“Build your first Docker image, run it, push it to Docker Hub, and share it.”

The objective is to demonstrate a complete end-to-end Docker workflow and validate foundational containerization skills.
## Overview
### The challenge consists of the following steps:
- Develop a minimal application to serve as the basis for the Docker image.
- Create a Dockerfile that defines the build instructions.
- Build the Docker image locally using the Docker CLI.
- Run and test the container to verify expected behavior.
- Publish the image to Docker Hub under a public repository.
- Share the Docker Hub link and repository as a final deliverable.

This repository contains all files used during the process.
